# React Lab 01 Template

Starter project for the IN432 React lab covering chapters 01–04.

## Getting Started

1. **Duplicate the folder**: Copy `lab-template` and rename it `react-lab01-<yourname>`.
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the printed URL in your browser to view the app.

## Project Structure

- `src/App.jsx` – Entry component composing the sample layout.
- `src/components/` – Place all new components here.
- `src/styles/lab-theme.css` – Predefined styling used throughout the lab.

Keep the theme CSS untouched and add extensions in a separate file if you need extra styles.
